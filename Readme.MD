I have uploaded almost all of my documents from my previous semesters to help my juniors continue their college study during lockdown.

How to access it?
Well, it's simple GitHub. If you still don't know GitHub, A. You should B. Find the <b>Clone and Download</b> green button and download it as zip. Later, you can open your downloads folder and extract the downloaded file using any data compression manager (7-Zip, etc).

<i>These notes are specifically for Integral University, BTech, Computer Science and Engineering students. Feel free to contribute your notes (just make sure to properly name the documents that you're willing to contribute).</i>
