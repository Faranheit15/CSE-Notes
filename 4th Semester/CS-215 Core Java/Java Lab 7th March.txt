We can use constructor to intialize instance varible during object creation.
We can use constructor to initialize an object not to create object.
Whenever we are creating an object, some ppiece of code will be executed automatically to perform initialisation of the object. This piece of code is nothing but constructor.
Hence, the main purpose of constructor is to perform initialisation of an object but not to create object.
